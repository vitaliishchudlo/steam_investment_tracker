# Steam Investment Tracker

This repository serves as a historical record and preserves the code and experience gained during the development of the Steam Investment Tracker project. 

## Description

The Steam Investment Tracker project focuses on empowering users to make informed investment decisions within the Steam ecosystem. By providing real-time updates on item prices, market trends, and trade opportunities, the tracker aims to enhance the investment experience for Steam users.

## Project Status

**This project is now closed.**

While developing the Steam Inventory Tracker, we stumbled upon an existing software that not only matched our project's functionalities but also boasted a strong user base and ongoing support. Therefore, it no longer makes sense to continue the development of our own implementation.
